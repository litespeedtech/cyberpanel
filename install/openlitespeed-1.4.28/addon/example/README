How to build the example module and use it.

There are four steps:

1, You need to compile and build it. You can simply use the ccc.sh script to compile and build the module.
For example:
  ./ccc.sh hellohandler.c
Then you will get the module file hellohandler.so

2, Copy the module file to $LSWS-HOME/modules/

3, In the admin console, Configuration/Server/Modules/, add the newly created module and enable it; in the above example, the name is hellohandler.

4, Restart openlitespeed and it should be added.
